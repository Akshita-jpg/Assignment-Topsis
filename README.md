## Google Colab Notebook
The TOPSIS method was implemented using Google Colab.  
The notebook performs the following steps:

1. Uploads input CSV file
2. Reads decision matrix
3. Normalizes data
4. Applies weights
5. Calculates ideal best and worst
6. Computes TOPSIS score
7. Ranks alternatives
8. Generates a bar graph for comparison

## Result Table
The output table includes:
- TOPSIS Score
- Rank for each alternative

## Result Graph
A bar graph is plotted to visually compare TOPSIS scores of alternatives.
